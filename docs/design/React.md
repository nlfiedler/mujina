# React

## Why React?

Of the popular JavaScript frameworks, React has the most elegant appearance. It
is principally a functional framework, lending to a clean design. It consists
largely of HTML tags with high-level semantic components. Connecting the
presentation and the event listeners is very simple, and they live close to each
other, in the same function or class. The connections are clearly spelled out,
leaving nothing to the imagination.

## React vs. Vue

One look at the 5 minute video on Vue.js shows us that it is hideous. It is
nothing more than glorified JQuery with special tag attributes. There is also
entirely too much "magic" gluing the presentational elements with the data,
akin to something you find in Ruby on Rails. When compared to React, which is
functional by design, it just looks ugly and difficult to understand.
