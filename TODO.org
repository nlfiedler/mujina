# TODO

## Wifey Enablement

### Course of Action

- [TODO] Improve the scrolling fluidity
  - Seems like the virtual paging is making the scrolling jittery
  - Perhaps some react-visibility settings could be employed
- [TODO] Drag and drop from Photos is not working
- [TODO] Install/Update Homebrew installation
- [TODO] Install node, gulp-cli, etc
- [TODO] Build mujina on her machine
- [TODO] Add a shortcut to start mujina

## Overall

- Look at the Flexbox section below and take care of some things
  - [TODO] Fix ThumbnailRow to use flexbox and not a table
  - [TODO] Fix up the image preview page
  - [TODO] Try to get the asset filters panel to stretch as desired
- [TODO] show N most recent assets by default
- [TODO] Add a 'reset all filters' button to the bottom of the asset filters
- [TODO] Design an "albums" feature
  - Add an "albums" field to the database records
  - Store them as a list of strings
  - Each asset can be in multiple albums
  - Enable selecting multiple assets to quickly assign albums
  - Show albums with the other filters, selectors
  - Wifey suggests "projects" instead of albums, but albums is more general
    - Photos has both albums and projects
- [TODO] Consider https://github.com/reactjs/reselect for efficiently selecting things (i.e. paging)
- [TODO] Consider options for streamlining development process
  - https://github.com/Quramy/electron-connect to reload electron
- [TODO] Investigate how to localize the app
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/oftn-l10n
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_content_best_practices
- [TODO] Consider storing assets in timestamped directories with original file names
  - How to deal with name collisions? Would that even happen?
  - If assets are uploaded individually, do they each go in a separate directory?
  - Would need an in-memory mapping of SHA256 to asset file path to avoid DB query
- [TODO] Find out how to handle unresponsive windows
- [TODO] Start filing issues to track progress, with milestones
- [TODO] Support browsing by year and month (likely without paging)
- [TODO] Bulk edit feature
  - Design a query page that allows searching on several fields (tags, date, location)
  - Use a temporary view (http://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/api/database/temp-views.html)
  - Multi-select the displayed results
  - Present a form for changing one or more fields of the selected assets
- [TODO] Option on asset screen to rotate an image (some images lack orientation data)
- [TODO] See https://github.com/Quramy/electron-jsx-babel-boilerplate/
  - uses gulp to minify and uglify everything

## Testing

- [TODO] Look into automated testing frameworks for Electron apps
- [TODO] See http://airbnb.io/enzyme/ for writing React tests
- [TODO] Read https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/testing

## Interface

### General

- [TODO] Maybe a set of Tabs to select between Pictures, Music, Videos, Documents, etc
- [TODO] Read https://fb.me/react-error-boundaries to learn about error handling
- [TODO] Add a route and page for viewing a single asset
- [TODO] Add menu item to open file selector to import new assets
- [TODO] Use bulma Level to make a toolbar sort of thing at the top/bottom
- [TODO] Consider setting the application menu appropriately for macOS and win32
- [TODO] Create a "New Window" menu item that invokes createWindow()
- [TODO] Set the browser window title (in index.html) to something sensible
- [TODO] Allow editing the attributes on an asset
- [TODO] When selecting attributes, disable those that no longer help

### Drop Zone

- [TODO] Consider some style tricks to show drop readiness
  - Handle the dragenter and dragleave events to add style properties dynamically
- [TODO] Probably need a progress bar for the uploads
- [TODO] Allow dragging out images (and videos?) as a form of export
  - Likely need a "File > Export" option with Save dialog for larger files

## Easy Browsing/Slideshow via web

- To compete with Apple Photos and the Apple TV photo browsing feature
  - Make it easy to peruse the assets organized as "memories"
  - Make a slideshow feature in the web interface

## Research

- [TODO] What does macOS Photos offer? Should at least be better than that
- [TODO] What does Windows 10 photos app offer? Should at least be better than that

## App/Daemon combo

- [TODO] Change backend to support 'upload' in which asset is already in position
- [TODO] Consider how to make app/backend combination more efficient
  - That is, if both are on the same machine, access assets directly
    - Can generate thumbnails and previews in the app vs backend
  - And, "upload" assets by storing them directly to the destination
  - Otherwise, must upload via HTTP

* Nice horizontal scrolling image viewer
  - https://codepen.io/argyleink/pen/Eaqec
  - ensure `flex-wrap: nowrap;` (the default)
  - should `align-items: center;`

* Image preview
  - Use `justify-content: center;` and `align-items: center;` to center the preview image
  - Probably bulma Container is the appropriate component

* Flexbox and scrollable content and height fill
