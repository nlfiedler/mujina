# TODO

## Overall

- [TODO] Detect duplicate assets on drop
  - At start of checksumDrops(), push to /upload route
  - As assets are processed 1-by-1, /upload page will show dropped files
  - After checksumming assets, query backend to check for duplicates
  - Flag duplicate assets and disable input on dropped files page
  - Show asset details: tags, location, caption
  - Help text below caption input should indicate its duplicateness
  - Mark the asset so it does not get uploaded
- [TODO] menu item for going to the upload screen
  - add a button on the upload screen to select additional files
- [TODO] Add a search bar across the top of most screens
  - support the fancy queries, like "tag:", "loc:", "before:2017-05", etc
  - multiple tags requires a "tag:" for each one
  - "is:image" and similar would be converted to "mimetype:image/*"
- [TODO] Design bulk edit solution, probably similar to JIRA
  - Access the bulk edit screen via a menu item
  - Use same search form as webui
  - Perform search, present list of results in a scrollable list
  - Check off results as desired
  - Next page allows:
    - add location
    - remove location
    - rename location
    - add a tag
    - remove a tag
    - rename a tag
    - set caption
    - change media type
- [TODO] Move TODO comments in the code to the Milestones.org file
- [TODO] Convert this file to a proper emacs org-mode file
- [TODO] Try to get the asset filters panel to stretch as desired (see flexbox section below)
  - may appear to be working, but resize the window to be sure
- [TODO] show N most recent assets by default (timeline style)
- [TODO] What does supporting emoji codes (in captions/comments) entail?
- [TODO] Investigate how to localize the app
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/oftn-l10n
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_content_best_practices
- [TODO] Find out how to handle unresponsive windows
- [TODO] See https://github.com/Quramy/electron-jsx-babel-boilerplate/
  - uses gulp to minify and uglify everything
- [TODO] Drag and drop from Photos is not working
  - No drag events are fired at all, it just does nothing

## Interface

### General

- [TODO] Improve the scrolling fluidity
  - Seems like the virtual paging is making the scrolling jittery
  - Perhaps some react-visibility settings could be employed
- [TODO] Maybe a set of Tabs to select between Pictures, Music, Videos, Documents, etc
- [TODO] Read https://fb.me/react-error-boundaries to learn about error handling
- [TODO] Add menu item to open file selector to import new assets
- [TODO] Use bulma Level to make a toolbar sort of thing at the top/bottom
- [TODO] Consider setting the application menu appropriately for macOS and win32
- [TODO] Create a "New Window" menu item that invokes createWindow()
- [TODO] Set the browser window title (in index.html) to something sensible
- [TODO] When selecting attributes, disable those that no longer help

### Bulma Extensions

- [TODO] use https://wikiki.github.io for bulma extensions
  - Tooltip, Tags input, Accordion, Carousel, QuickView, Timeline
- [TODO] making text not selectable, Bloomer has isUnselectable
- Carousel
  - Bulma extensions has a Carousel component
  - Good for swiping through a bunch of assets
  - Need to make clicking the arrows fire a fetchAsset action
  - Use this in the ThumbnailRow component
- Timeline
  - Use the Bulma-Extensions Timeline component to show assets sorted by date
- Better tags input
   - Use Bulma-Extensions TagsInput on the asset edit screen

### Drop Zone

- [TODO] Consider some style tricks to show drop readiness
  - Handle the dragenter and dragleave events to add style properties dynamically
- [TODO] Allow dragging out images (and videos?) as a form of export
  - Likely need a "File > Export" option with Save dialog for larger files
