# TODO

## Learning

- [DONE] Go through Dan Abramov's Redux course on egghead.io

  - [DONE] Look at using https://github.com/socialtables/redux-unhandled-action
  - [DONE] Look at `normalizr` npm for "Normalizing API Responses" (see Abramov's react #26)
  - [DONE] Look at https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger
- [DONE] Look for examples of source code layout
- [DONE] Use React to build the tags list
  - [DONE] Implement the TOGGLE_TAG in reducers.js
  - [DONE] Use some styling to make the tag list look interesting
  - [DONE] Use https://github.com/hardchor/electron-redux so main/renderer share a single instance
- [DONE] Introduce bulma or something for the styling
  - [DONE] Add some placeholder content in the middle
  - [DONE] Build the thumbnail grid using Table and Card
  - [DONE] Add the years and locations selectors
- [TODO] Consider https://github.com/reactjs/reselect for efficiently selecting things (i.e. paging)
- [DONE] See how Dan Abramov uses thunks and redux to handle "loading" status
- [TODO] Consider options for streamlining development process
  - https://github.com/Quramy/electron-connect to reload electron
- [TODO] Investigate how to localize the app
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/oftn-l10n
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_content_best_practices
- [TODO] Consider storing assets in timestamped directories with original file names
  - How to deal with name collisions? Would that even happen?
  - If assets are uploaded individually, do they each go in a separate directory?
  - Would need an in-memory mapping of SHA256 to asset file path to avoid DB query
- [TODO] Look into automated testing frameworks for Electron apps
- [TODO] Find out how to handle unresponsive windows
- [TODO] Start filing issues to track progress, with milestones
- [TODO] Make the number of cached thumbnails depend on the available memory
- [TODO] Support browsing by year and month (likely without paging)
- [TODO] Show video thumbnails using video HTML tag so they can play directly
- [TODO] Show selected frames from videos on hover
- [TODO] Bulk edit feature
  - Design a query page that allows searching on several fields (tags, date, location)
  - Use a temporary view (http://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/api/database/temp-views.html)
  - Multi-select the displayed results
  - Present a form for changing one or more fields of the selected assets
- [TODO] Option on asset screen to rotate an image (some images lack orientation data)
- [TODO] See https://github.com/Quramy/electron-jsx-babel-boilerplate/
  - uses gulp to minify and uglify everything

## Interface

### General

- [DONE] Go through a React tutorial (again)
- [DONE] Read https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html
- [DONE] Set up gulp to build the React components
- [DONE] Plug the React components into index.html
- [DONE] Move source code into some directory
- [DONE] Read https://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html for integrating redux
- [DONE] Maybe watch https://reactforbeginners.com; not really relevant
- [DONE] Add some padding around the entire App
- [TODO] See how https://github.com/erikras/redux-form can help
- [TODO] See how https://github.com/davidkpiano/react-redux-form can help
- [TODO] See http://airbnb.io/enzyme/ for writing React tests
- [TODO] Add menu item to open file selector to import new assets
- [TODO] Use bulma Level to make a toolbar sort of thing at the top/bottom
- [TODO] Consider setting the application menu appropriately for macOS and win32
- [TODO] Create a "New Window" menu item that invokes createWindow()
- [TODO] Set the browser window title (in index.html) to something sensible

### Routing

- [TODO] Decide on how to do routing (static vs dynamic), see NOTES.md
- [TODO] Use https://reacttraining.com/react-router/ for routing
  - It has react-router-redux to stay in sync with redux

### Drop Zone

- [DONE] Consider https://react-dropzone.js.org
- [DONE] Consider https://github.com/electron-utils/electron-drag-drop/
- [DONE] Consider http://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/
- [TODO] Fire a redux action to signal received files
  - Use the files:upload handler in main.js to perform the upload
- [TODO] Show uploaded assets in a list with editable fields
- [TODO] Commit edited data to the corresponding database records
- [TODO] Consider some style tricks to show drop readiness
  - Handle the dragenter and dragleave events to add style properties dynamically

## Research

- [TODO] What does macOS Photos offer? Should at least be better than that

## App/Daemon combo

- [TODO] Change backend to support 'upload' in which asset is already in position
- [TODO] Consider how to make app/backend combination more efficient
  - That is, if both are on the same machine, access assets directly
    - Can generate thumbnails and previews in the app vs backend
  - And, "upload" assets by storing them directly to the destination
  - Otherwise, must upload via HTTP
