# TODO

## Learning

- [DONE] Go through Dan Abramov's Redux course on egghead.io
- [DONE] Go through Dan Abramov's React/Redux course
- [DONE] What is the difference between `export` and `exports`?
  * The `export` statement is new and only supported in Chrome and Safari.
  * Transpilers such as Babel support it

## Overall

- [DONE] Get it connected to the backend, log tags in console
- [DONE] Get a list of available tags, show in the page
- [DONE] Set up a persistent configuration for development
- [DONE] Learn how to write doc comments (apparently it's JSDoc)
- [DONE] Create a drop zone for drag-n-drop; combine with file selector
- [DONE] Have dropped files get uploaded into the backend
- [DONE] Add a copyright header to all of the source code
- [DONE] Write a basic README file
- [DONE] Figure out how to manage multiple windows
- [DONE] Set the minimum size of the main window to something reasonable
- [TODO] Figure out how to add React and Redux
- [TODO] Look for examples of source code layout
- [TODO] Model the state of the application in Redux
- [TODO] Use React to build the tags list
- [TODO] Use React to build the drop zone
- [TODO] Show uploaded assets in a list with editable fields
- [TODO] Commit edited data to the corresponding database records
- [TODO] Investigate how to localize the app
  * https://www.npmjs.com/package/oftn-l10n
  * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_content_best_practices
- [TODO] Decide on how to do routing (static vs dynamic), see NOTES.md
- [TODO] Consider storing assets in timestamped directories with original file names
  * How to deal with name collisions? Would that even happen?
  * If assets are uploaded individually, do they each go in a separate directory?
  * Would need an in-memory mapping of SHA256 to asset file path to avoid DB query
- [TODO] Look into automated testing frameworks
- [TODO] Look at `normalizr` npm for "Normalizing API Responses" (see Abramov's react #26)
- [TODO] Consider setting the application menu appropriately for macOS and win32
- [TODO] Create a "New Window" menu item that invokes createWindow()
- [TODO] Find out how to handle unresponsive windows

## App/Daemon combo

- [TODO] Change backend to support 'upload' in which asset is already in position
