** Next
*** Asset page
**** TODO ThumbnailColumn should use (visible) placeholders while image loads
**** TODO Clicking on asset in preview screen should show it full size
- Need a semi-transparent "delete" button in the corner to go back
**** TODO Re-evaluate using the thumbnail row, called a "thumbnail carousel"
- c.f. https://tympanus.net/Tutorials/ResponsiveImageGallery/

**** TODO Use an "image slider" to move from one asset to the next
- There are lots and lots of these
- c.f. https://github.com/benhowell/react-grid-gallery

**** TODO Fix ThumbnailColumn =Box= dimensions so they are not hard-coded values
- Especially the height, which is annoying
- Play with width value, too, to find optimal value

**** TODO ThumbnailColumn should not spread out thumbnails vertically
**** TODO Get ThumbnailColumn =Container= to add space between thumbnails
- auto margins are not working as hoped
- currently adds space between the rows, not the elements
- Develop the algo for sizing the images with margins, like for thumbnail view

**** TODO AssetSidebar =Box= style should not have to set the width
- Using =position: fixed= is messing with the width

*** Thumbnail view
**** TODO Try not using =Tile= for the Home page, seems to interact poorly with children
- This probably will fix the next todo item
- Have the =AssetFilters= and =Thumbnails= as direct children of a =div=, like =SearchPage=

**** TODO Seems like AttributeList =div= is not an ideal solution
- It has a hard-coded width which _is_ altering the layout
- Makes more sense to remove div and let =PanelBlock= parent manage the children

**** TODO Have a sensible placeholder for the broken images
- Select "angela" in "2016" to see an example

**** TODO Fetch results as needed, rather than all at once
- Have to fetch for =AssetSelector= component as well
- Because of the thumbnail size calculation, first fetch is really slow
- Should fetch new results as the user scrolls down
- Need new actions that append to the results rather than overwrite
  - action includes the page number to fetch
- Fetch a batch at a time (like 18) until there are enough to fill the screen

**** TODO Hover should show asset date/time, caption, maybe filename
- See =Image.js= in https://github.com/benhowell/react-grid-gallery
**** TODO Use hover "overlay" button to select assets to operate on
- See =CheckButton.js= in https://github.com/benhowell/react-grid-gallery
*** Quick Ones
**** TODO Allow editing the media type of assets
*** Glitches
**** TODO When scrolling thumbnails very quickly, seems to stop rendering at all
**** TODO Does =react-lazyload-fadein= support unloading the images when they are no longer visible?
- May be =react-transition-group= supports this?
- Or may need to hack/extend =react-lazyload-fadein= to do it

**** TODO Handle search query string errors better
- Currently, an error in the query goes to the error page without any helpful hint
- Currently, once the query is wrong, you can never fix it because it directly goes to the error page

**** TODO Show helpful text and examples on search page instead of results
*** Bulk Edit
**** TODO Short term solution akin to perkeep web interface [0/4]
- [ ] Easy selection with hover checkbox button
  - Could use =svg= tag to render the button
  - See pexels.com in that it uses article tag, with nested img and button with nested svg
- [ ] When selections, filters panel changes to show available actions
- [ ] Actions include adding, deleting tags, setting location
  - This is basically a simplified bulk edit
- [ ] Use a prefix for the checksum values

**** TODO Design bulk edit solution, probably similar to JIRA [0/5]
- [ ] Access the bulk edit screen via a menu item
- [ ] Use same search form as webui
- [ ] Perform search, present list of results in a scrollable list
- [ ] Check off results as desired
- [ ] Next page presents several operations [0/8]
  - [ ] add location
  - [ ] remove location
  - [ ] rename location
  - [ ] add a tag
  - [ ] remove a tag
  - [ ] rename a tag
  - [ ] set caption
  - [ ] change media type

*** Uploads
**** TODO Try to center the thumbnail vertically on the dropped files page
**** TODO Show a larger thumbnail on hover over small thumbnail
**** TODO Add menu/button to navigate to upload screen
- Big "primary" style button on home screen?
- Menu item to reach upload screen
- Add a button on the upload screen to select additional files

**** TODO Tag and location completion on uploads page
**** TODO Add a button to remove a single upload entry from the list
**** TODO Can the upload thumbnails be improved, they are kinda grainy
**** TODO Upload progress bar needs to be made visible
- Either squeeze it between the save/cancel buttons
- Or scroll down to the bottom fo the page when save button is pressed

**** TODO Consider how to show uploads.error in NewFileList page
**** TODO Sometimes dropping an image just opens the image
- Is there a React event that App can listen for, like "unmount"?
  - and if that happens, fire an action to navigate back home
- How to prevent this behavior?
- http://www.danieleckermann.com/blog/electron-prevent-dropped-file-from-opening
- Maybe intercept the 'will-nagivate' event?
  - Would need to know if our app initiated the event
- Maybe a menu item to get back "Home"
- Maybe a periodic check in main.js to ensure webContents are what is expected
**** TODO Consider a "recent uploads" button to show newly added assets
**** TODO Show a fancy help overlay thingy on dragover
- See Slack, which shows an overlay while dragging over the window
- Probably need to add dragover and drop handlers to the top-level App component

*** Videos
**** TODO Get video playback working again
- Also does not work with webui in Chrome
- Seems to work with some videos (like potowatomi from 2014)

**** TODO How to get large videos into storage?
- Files up to 100MB seem to be okay, but what about really large files?

**** TODO Use video tag for thumbnail view
**** TODO Show 5 or so frames from the video on hover
**** TODO Show placeholder icons for videos that fail to load

*** TODO Update Electron
** Investigate
*** TODO How to search for assets with no tags or location?
- GraphQL works, but it is beyond the capability of non-technical people

*** TODO What does supporting emoji codes (in captions/comments) entail?
*** TODO Investigate how to localize the app
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/oftn-l10n
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_content_best_practices

*** TODO Find out how to handle unresponsive windows
*** TODO See https://github.com/Quramy/electron-jsx-babel-boilerplate/
- uses gulp to minify and uglify everything

*** TODO Drag and drop from Photos is not working
- No drag events are fired at all, it just does nothing
- See the Electron guide for native drag & drop
- Handle 'open-url' and/or 'open-file' on the app instance in main.js
- Maybe look at that relatively new DataTransfer API business

** Upcoming
*** Refinements
**** TODO Show filters tab containing first selection
That is, if only a location is selected, when switching back to the home page,
the tags tab is selected by default, and the locations is not showing.

**** TODO Advanced search features
***** TODO "is:image" and similar are converted to "mimetype:image/*" :tanuki:
***** TODO "with:<name>" for searching people
***** TODO logical operators (and, or) and grouping with parentheses

**** TODO Have a timeline feature like Google Photos
- Looks like Time Machine timeline, with marks and years, expands on hover

**** TODO Show N most recent assets by default (timeline style)
**** TODO Use bulma Level to make a toolbar sort of thing at the top/bottom
**** TODO Consider setting the application menu appropriately for macOS and win32
**** TODO Create a "New Window" menu item that invokes createWindow()
**** TODO Set the browser window title (in index.html) to something sensible
**** TODO When selecting attributes, disable those that no longer help
**** TODO Maybe a set of Tabs to select between Pictures, Music, Videos, Documents, etc
**** TODO Read https://fb.me/react-error-boundaries to learn about error handling

*** Bulma Extensions
**** TODO use https://wikiki.github.io for bulma extensions
- Tooltip, Tags input, Accordion, Carousel, QuickView, Timeline

**** TODO employ tooltip feature for the following [0/4]
- [ ] Edit button on the asset preview page
- [ ] Save button on asset edit page
- [ ] Asset preview image, show the asset ID, file size, media type
- [ ] Show full asset identifier as tooltip on asset sidebar

**** TODO For making text not selectable, Bloomer has isUnselectable

**** Carousel
- Bulma extensions has a Carousel component
- Good for swiping through a bunch of assets
- Need to make clicking the arrows fire a fetchAsset action
- Use this in the ThumbnailColumn component

**** Timeline
- Use the Bulma-Extensions Timeline component to show assets sorted by date

**** Better tags input
- Use Bulma-Extensions TagsInput on the asset edit screen

*** File export
**** TODO Allow dragging out images (and videos?) as a form of export
- Likely need a "File > Export" option with Save dialog for larger files
- https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/native-file-drag-drop
