** Next

*** TODO Detect duplicate assets on drop [0/7]
- [ ] At start of checksumDrops(), push to /upload route
- [ ] As assets are processed 1-by-1, /upload page will show dropped files
- [ ] After checksumming assets, query backend to check for duplicates
- [ ] Flag duplicate assets and disable input on dropped files page
- [ ] Show asset details: tags, location, caption
- [ ] Help text below caption input should indicate its duplicateness
- [ ] Mark the asset so it does not get uploaded

*** TODO Add menu item for going to the upload screen
- Add a button on the upload screen to select additional files

*** TODO Add a search bar across the top of most screens
- Support the fancy queries, like "tag:", "loc:", "before:2017-05", etc
- Multiple tags requires a "tag:" for each one
- "is:image" and similar would be converted to "mimetype:image/*"

*** TODO Design bulk edit solution, probably similar to JIRA [0/5]
- [ ] Access the bulk edit screen via a menu item
- [ ] Use same search form as webui
- [ ] Perform search, present list of results in a scrollable list
- [ ] Check off results as desired
- [ ] Next page presents several operations [0/8]
  - [ ] add location
  - [ ] remove location
  - [ ] rename location
  - [ ] add a tag
  - [ ] remove a tag
  - [ ] rename a tag
  - [ ] set caption
  - [ ] change media type

*** TODO Support videos better [0/1]
- [ ] Show videos using the video tag
- [ ] Show duration for videos
- [ ] Use video tag for thumbnail view
- [ ] Show 5 or so frames from the video on hover
- [ ] Show placeholder icons for videos that fail to load

** Investigate

*** TODO What does supporting emoji codes (in captions/comments) entail?
*** TODO Investigate how to localize the app
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/oftn-l10n
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_content_best_practices

*** TODO Find out how to handle unresponsive windows
*** TODO See https://github.com/Quramy/electron-jsx-babel-boilerplate/
- uses gulp to minify and uglify everything

*** TODO Drag and drop from Photos is not working
- No drag events are fired at all, it just does nothing
- See the Electron guide for native drag & drop

** Upcoming
*** Buggy Interface
**** TODO Try to get the asset filters panel to stretch as desired
- See flexbox section below
- May appear to be working, but resize the window to be sure
- Need to somehow set the height of the panelContent Block
- Maybe set min-height: 100vh on the body

- https://codepen.io/anon/pen/doyVxj

**** TODO Try to center the thumbnail vertically on the dropped files page

**** TODO Improve the scrolling fluidity
- Seems like the virtual paging is making the scrolling jittery
- Perhaps some react-visibility settings could be employed

*** Refinements
**** TODO Add a trash/delete icon next to dropped file to remove individual files
**** TODO Show N most recent assets by default (timeline style)
**** TODO Use bulma Level to make a toolbar sort of thing at the top/bottom
**** TODO Consider setting the application menu appropriately for macOS and win32
**** TODO Create a "New Window" menu item that invokes createWindow()
**** TODO Set the browser window title (in index.html) to something sensible
**** TODO When selecting attributes, disable those that no longer help
**** TODO Maybe a set of Tabs to select between Pictures, Music, Videos, Documents, etc
**** TODO Read https://fb.me/react-error-boundaries to learn about error handling

*** Bulma Extensions
**** TODO use https://wikiki.github.io for bulma extensions
- Tooltip, Tags input, Accordion, Carousel, QuickView, Timeline

**** TODO employ tooltip feature for the following [0/4]
- [ ] Edit button on the asset preview page
- [ ] Save button on asset edit page
- [ ] Asset preview image, show the asset ID, file size, media type
- [ ] Show full asset identifier as tooltip on asset sidebar

**** TODO For making text not selectable, Bloomer has isUnselectable

**** Carousel
- Bulma extensions has a Carousel component
- Good for swiping through a bunch of assets
- Need to make clicking the arrows fire a fetchAsset action
- Use this in the ThumbnailRow component

**** Timeline
- Use the Bulma-Extensions Timeline component to show assets sorted by date

**** Better tags input
- Use Bulma-Extensions TagsInput on the asset edit screen

*** Drop zone improvements
**** TODO Consider some style tricks to show drop readiness
- Handle the dragenter and dragleave events to add style properties dynamically

**** TODO Allow dragging out images (and videos?) as a form of export
- Likely need a "File > Export" option with Save dialog for larger files
